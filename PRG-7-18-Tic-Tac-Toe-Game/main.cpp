//  Write a program that allows two players to play a game of tic-tac-toe. Use a two-
//  dimensional char array with three rows and three columns as the game board. Each
//  element of the array should be initialized with an asterisk (*). The program should run a
//  loop that does the following:
//
//  * Displays the contents of the board array.
//  * Allows player 1 to select a location on the board for an X. The program should ask
//    the user to enter the row and column numbers.
//  * Allows player 2 to select a location on the board for an O. The program should ask
//    the user to enter the row and column numbers.
//  * Determines whether a play has won, or a tie has occurred. If a player has won,
//    the program should declare that player the winner and end. If a tie has occurred, the
//    program should display an appropriate message and end.
//
//  Player 1 wins when there are three X's in a row on the game board. The Xs can appear in a
//  row, in a column, or diagonally across the board. Player 2 wins when there are three Os in
//  a row on the game board. The Os can appear in a row, in a column, or diagonally across
//  the board. A tie occurs when all of the locations on the board are full, but there is no winner.
